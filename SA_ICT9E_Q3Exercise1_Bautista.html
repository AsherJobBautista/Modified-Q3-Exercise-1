				<h3 class="text-primary">HyperText Markup Language</h3>
				<p><b>HTML</p></b>
				<p>HTML or HyperText Markup Language is basically the building blocks of what you will make, assisted by CSS. It was created by Tim Burners-Lee in the year of 1990, and consists of many container and empty tags. the 4 primary tags in HTML are the body tag, head tag, html tag, and title tag. You can style the HTML in many ways by using different kinds of attributes and additional tags, such as the bgcolor attribute or the paragraph tag, you can also generally change how big a text is by using the headers, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6, which range from biggest to smallest. You can also try adding different fonts and links by using the "a" tag, which is also called an anchor tag. You can also arrange your content by using lists of tags such as the ol or ul list type of tag. You can even add images that you like or would want to have in your website and codes by using the img src tag and then putting the name of the image into the next lines, always make sure the HTML file and saved image are both in the same folder though or else the image itself will either be blank or show a little broken shape of an image.</p>

			<p><b>Cascading Style Sheets</p></b>
			<p>Cascading Style Sheets or CSS for short is something that was made for an easier way to maintain and share certain sites and style sheets, it also controls how a website appears by modifying the HTML file you are creating, think of it as arranging and expanding your HTML codes in a way of adding more and easier ways to add certain tags and attributes. There are different kinds of Cascading Style Sheets that I will go into detail here, such examples here are the Internal, External, and Inline CSS, the difference is where they are situated or located in the codes that you are creating. Many properties are like the text color, background color, etc. </p>
